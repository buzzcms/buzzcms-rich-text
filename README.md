## Principle

- Accessibility


## Image

* The image element contains:
  * id: The id of the image, which can be used for transform later
  * src: Link normal img src attribute
  * caption: The caption the show behind the image, render in `<figcaption />` tag
* Insert image via copy/paste maybe store the image content as blob, or keep the link. The backend maybe downloads the image & save it to the Cms server.
